# Advent of Code 2019

My solutions for https://adventofcode.com/2019

Some of us at work (https://www.thomasnet.com/) compete in a private leaderboard.

Each numbered directory contains that day's code. Within each dir, 1.js is part one and 2.js is part two. For example, to run part 1 of day 2:

Initial setup of common files:
```
cd common
npm install
```

Run day 2, part 1:
```
(Assuming the input is copied to your clipboard)
cd 2
npm install
pbpaste | ./1.js
```
